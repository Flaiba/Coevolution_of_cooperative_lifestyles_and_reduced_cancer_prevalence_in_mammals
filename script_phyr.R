# For the CMR model, it is necessary to use a binomial distribution with a logit link function.
# In the phyr package, the binomial response must be specified as the number of successes (Neoplasia)
# and the number of failures (i.e., animals that died from causes other than Neoplasia).

# One important point to consider is that the phyr package only allows mixed models, so it is mandatory to include a random effect.
# "Fortunately", overdispersion is a common issue in binomial models.
# Thus, as a first approximation, we assume that overdispersion is present and include a random effect at the species level.
# This is a common method for accounting for overdispersion, known as OLRE (observation-level random effects).

# Before fitting Model 1 (M1), which includes phylogeny, we can fit a model that includes "Species" as a random effect, but does not account for phylogeny. This preliminary model allows us to test for overdispersion.
# However, itâ€™s important to consider that any detected overdispersion might stem from not including phylogenetic structure.
# Unfortunately, there is currently no reliable way to assess overdispersion in a model that includes phylogeny.

## Model diagnostics and interpretation
# First, we observe that the model does not fit the binomial distribution well, and the residuals are not randomly distributed.
# Nevertheless, this model provides the best possible option within a frequentist framework.
# An alternative would be to use Bayesian methods.
# Here, we model both the overdispersion and the phylogenetic non-independence between taxa.
# While not perfect, this model is consistent with the simpler model that excludes phylogeny (Model 0), and it provides a better fit overall.
# I prefer a suboptimal model whose limitations are clearly acknowledged over not modeling the data at all.

# Second, note that we included all taxa in the analysis, even those with a CMR of 0.
# This allowed us to test for zero-inflation, and no evidence of excess zeros was found.
# Using the complete dataset results in a more comprehensive analysis.

# Fit Model 0 (no phylogeny)
M0 <- glmmTMB(cbind(Neoplasia, knownDeaths - Neoplasia) ~ Adult_life_expectancy + order + body.mass + Vertebrate + (1 | Species),
              data = filtered_data2, family = "binomial")

# This model appears to perform adequately, but it does not account for phylogeny.
# Therefore, its inferences are unreliable due to the known phylogenetic signal in the data,
# which violates the assumption of independence between taxa.
